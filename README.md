# Event-Venue-Ticket-Purchasing-React-Webapp

This is a React-based web application designed to facilitate purchasing tickets for various events, such as concerts and shows. The app prioritizes a user-friendly interface for browsing upcoming events, viewing event details, filtering and searching for events, and completing ticket purchases seamlessly.

See deployed project [here](https://eewilson32.github.io/EventVenueV6).

## User Goals

The application is designed with the following user-centered goals in mind:

- View available events, including the showing's title, date, time, and ticket prices.
- Search for specific events using a search bar and filters.
- Access detailed information about an event, such as descriptions, seating options, etc.
- Save events for later or reserve tickets by adding-to-cart.
- Select preferred tickets, specify quantities, and proceed to purchase.
- Access FAQs, support pages, venue policies, contact information, and directions.

# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Please review and install the following prerequisites:
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

> **Note: Ensure you have Node.js installed. npm comes bundled with Node.js, so installing Node.js will also install npm.**

## Dependency Installation Instructions

> ### **On macOS** (using Homebrew)
1. Open your terminal and run:
    ```brew install node```
 
> ### **On Ubuntu/Debian** (using NodeSource)
1. Open your terminal and run:
    - ```sudo apt update``` to udate your package list.
    - ```sudo apt install -y curl``` to install additional prerequisites.
3. Add the Node.js repository and install Node.js:
    - ```curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -```
    - ```sudo apt install -y nodejs```

> ### **On Windows** (using Windows Package Manager)
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
    ```winget install OpenJS.NodeJS```
> ### **After installation, run ```node -v``` and ```npm -v``` to verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly.**

## Project Installation Instructions

## More Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
